## Launcher

The launcher is an easier way to install and use mods.

However, you can still manually download mods on this website!

Grab a copy: [Launcher Download](https://github.com/DesktopGooseUnofficial/launcher/releases/latest).

## Installation guide

First, make sure that you are running Desktop Goose v0.3.

There should be a "Mods" folder in the "Assets" folder. If not, you're running v0.2.
Go to the [Desktop Goose page on itch.io](https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose) to download v0.3.
The macOS version does not support mods yet.

**Need help? Something not working right?** Feel free to ask for support in the [#goose-mods channel on the discord server](https://discord.gg/yjGFsUD).
